## Release process

Releases are made by tagging the monorepo with a tag using the pattern
`module/semver`, for example `gherkin/v7.4.8`. The CI build takes care of the rest:

- Tag each module repo with the `semver` part of the monorepo tag.
- Trigger a Travis build for each module repo.
- Publish packages (maven, npm, rubygems etc) if the (tagged) build is successful.

## Releasing a module

*Note:* When a module is released, artefacts will be published for *all* implementations
of the module, and all associated module repos will be tagged.

Triggering a release is simple:

    # For example
    source scripts/functions.sh && release_module gherkin 7.4.8 # Don't specify the v in the version

This will update the various package descriptors (`pom.xml`, `package.json`, `*.gemspec`)
in the module implementations. A git commit will be created with message "Release gherkin v7.4.8". 
This commit is also tagged with `gherkin/v7.4.8`. Everything is pushed, which will kick 
off the release process above.

### Triggering tagged builds

After you push a tag, each module repo will start building in parallel. If a module
has a dependency on the go implementation (such as `gherkin`, `dots-formatter` and
`pretty-formatter`), the build will initially fail because it can only pass after 
the go executables have been published and available for download.

The go module will trigger a new build of dependent module repos after a successful
tagged build. This second time the builds should pass and successfully publish packages.

## Configuring a module dir for automated releases

Before a module can be released automatically, a few scripts and files must be 
modified/added and committed to the monorepo.

### Set up GPG signing keys

We aim to sign all published packages. Currently this is only done for Maven
packages.

The GPG key in use is for the `cukebot@cucumber.io` machine user, which has id `E60E1F911B996560FFB135DAF4CABFB5B89B8BE6`. You have to install this key.
You'll find it in 1Password under *devs@cucumber.io sub signing key*. (TODO: check
if this is correct).

    brew install gpg gpg-agent
    travis login --github-token # 1Password: Travis API Token (cukebot)
    gpg --import private-key.asc

Add signing keys to the module dir:

    source scripts/functions.sh && setup_gpg gherkin/javascript

This will add the encrypted signing key and configure Travis to decrypt it during
a module build.

### Package repository security credentials

Security credentials for the various package repositories must be encrypted
in each `.travis.yml` file. How to do this is slightly different depending
on the platform. This is described in details below.

#### Java (Maven)

A lot of GPG stuff needs to be added to `pom.xml`. See one of the existing projects,
such as `gherkin/java/pom.xml`.

#### Ruby (Rubygems)

Cd into the module dir and run:

# Set AUTH_TOKEN to the value from 1Password

Cd into the module dir and run:

    # Find the AUTH_TOKEN at https://rubygems.org/profile/edit (cukebot login password in 1Password)
    travis encrypt "${AUTH_TOKEN}" --repo cucumber/gherkin-javascript --add deploy.api_key

For more details, follow the Travis [RubyGems Deployment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/rubygems/) guide.

#### JavaScript (NPM)

Cd into the module dir and run:

    # Set AUTH_TOKEN to the value from 1Password
    travis encrypt "${AUTH_TOKEN}" --repo cucumber/gherkin-javascript --add deploy.api_key

For more details, follow the Travis [NPM Releasing](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/npm/) guide.

#### Go (modules)

Starting with Go 1.11, releasing a go module is simply a matter of pushing a git tag,
so there is nothing extra to set up. The tag is pushed by the `release_module` command.
